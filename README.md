# EOS
EOS-agent-based model for neighborhood peak-load shaving through EVs
This repository includes sample data used for household energy use profile generated from Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) and the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). 
The profile is used for EOS, an agent-based model that runs on NetLogo to simulate how EV adoption rate in a mid-size US neighborhood impacts on the neighborhood peak-load shaving.
